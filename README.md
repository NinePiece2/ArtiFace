# Human-Face-Generator

## Introduction

Human Face Generator is a deep learning project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate human faces based on celebrity images. The project uses the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train the GANs. The project is implemented in Python using the Keras API and Tensorflow Backend.

The end goal for the project is to create realistic human faces that can be used for syntehtic data generation and other applications.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset used for this project is the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA). The dataset contains 202,599 images of human faces with 40 binary attributes. The images are 218x178 pixels in size. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

The following are some of the images from the dataset:
